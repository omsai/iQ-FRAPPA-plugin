Installation
------------
Strictly speaking you can simply right-click on the .py file, save it anywhere,
and open the file in iQ's Python IDE to run the code.

However, the Python IDE searches a folder specific to make programs visible in
its plugins menu -

    C:/Program Files/Andor Bioimaging/Plugins/

To this directory, you can download the .py file or (better) clone the Git 
repository there so that the script is easily accessible.
