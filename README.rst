Installation
============

As a Plugin
-----------
The Python IDE searches a specific folder to make programs visible in its 
plugins menu -

    C:/Program Files/Andor Bioimaging/Plugins/

Download the .py file to this directory, by right-clicking on the .py file in 
Github and save it from your web browser.  Now when you restart / start the 
Python IDE in iQ you will always see this program in the plugins menu.


Updating
--------
Register as a Github user to watch the project for updates.
