Plugin Installation
===================

The Python IDE searches a specific `plugins directory`_ to make programs visible in its 
plugins menu.

#. Developers can clone the Git respository to that directory.

   Users can download the zip file by clicking on "Tags" on the top right and 
   select the applicable release.

#. Now when you restart / start the Python IDE you will always see this 
   program in the plugins menu.

Plugins directory
=================
``C:/Program Files/Andor Bioimaging/PythonEngine/Plugins/``

It was different in iQ 2.4.4 and earlier:

``C:/Program Files/Andor Bioimaging/Plugins/``
